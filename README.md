# Hibernate Weekend Homework
Your task is to model relationships between classes and persist them via Hibernate. Practice using annotations, table relationships and inheritance.
We're looking for accurate representations, don't force the use of table relationships or inheritance if it doesn't make sense.

### MVP
Create CRUD functions through a DBHelper.

### Hollywood
Model the relationships between Studios, Directors, Films, Actors/Actresses etc.

### Extensions

payActor (studio budget goes down, actors cash goes up)
show the amount of films a actor has appeared in by genre
